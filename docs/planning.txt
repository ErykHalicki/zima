add camera on top of arm
add speaker inside chassis (eventually)
run arm pose requests and movement requests

ML project ideas (sequential):

Classical NN track (1):
1. Train CNN from scratch on MNIST
2. pre trained NN feature extraction -> train object detection model from scratch

Transformer track (2):
0. Bigram model / text prediction
1. Train character level text prediction (elaborate)
2. Train ViT from scratch on MNIST
3. Pretrained ViT -> object detection?

Robotics track (3):
1. train a policy using ResNet or similar backbone + action expert / motor policy (standard feedforward or RNN) at the end (similar to VLA, but more like Vision-Action, no language (for a single task))
2. add pretrained ViT backbone
3. add transformer based action expert
