# Zima Hardware Interface

## Overview

The Zima Hardware Interface is a modular Arduino sketch designed to control multiple hardware components for the Zima robotic platform, including:
- Servo Motors (8 channels)
- Rotary Encoders (2 channels)
- DC Motors (2 channels)

## Hardware Bootup Considerations

### EN Pin Capacitor Fix

**Important Hardware Modification:**
- Add a 1µF capacitor between EN and GND
- This resolves intermittent bootup issues with the ESP32
- Helps stabilize the chip during power-on sequence
- Prevents random boot failures or serial communication problems

#### Recommended Capacitor Specification
- Capacitance: 1 µF (microfarad)
- Voltage Rating: 6.3V or higher
- Type: Ceramic or Electrolytic

### Bootup Sequence Notes
- Ensure stable power supply
- Use the recommended EN pin capacitor
- Verify all connections before powering on
